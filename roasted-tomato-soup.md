## Ingredients
* 2 1/2 pounds fresh tomatoes, about 5-6 medium sized tomatoes
* 6 cloves garlic, peeled
* 2 small yellow onions, sliced
* 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 1 quart chicken stock
* 2 bay leaves
* 4 tablespoons butter
* 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil leaves
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

2. Wash and core the tomatoes, then slice each one in half. Place the tomatoes, garlic and onion on a baking sheet. Drizzle with the olive oil and use your hands to make sure each piece is evenly covered. Lightly salt and pepper the tomato mixture. Roast the tomatoes for 30 minutes, or until the onion and garlic begin to brown and the tomatoes start to caramelize.

3. When the tomatoes are finished cooking, carefully move the pan contents into a large saucepan. (At this point you will have a layer of the most delicious olive oil coating your pan. Be kind and share some with the soup, then take the leftovers and slather over a piece of crusty bread, or a finger.) Add 3/4 of the chicken stock, butter and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer for 15 minutes. Puree with an immersion blender if you own one, or puree in batches in a blender.  You want to puree until the soup is smooth and the tomato skins are no longer visible.  Return the soup to the pot. Add the cream if you are using and then adjust the consistency with more chicken stock. I usually do not add any more stock. Garnish in each bowl with a few of the chopped basil leaves and a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese.

4. Serve with fresh mozzarella grilled cheese sandwiches.
