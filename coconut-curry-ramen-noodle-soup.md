## Ingredients
* 24 ounces coconut milk
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 2 1/2 tablespoons red curry paste
* 1 habanero pepper, seeds and stem removed, minced
* 1 jalapeño pepper, seeds and stem removed, minced
* 1 pound sweet Italian sausage, removed from it’s casing (if applicable)
* salt
* pepper
* 3 cups chicken broth
* 2 carrots, peeled and shredded
* 3 small stalks lemongrass, peeled
* 1 tablespoon fish sauce
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce, plus more as needed
* 2 tablespoons lime juice
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated
* 1 cup baby bok choy, diced
* 1/4 cup red bell pepper, diced
* 1/4 cup orange bell pepper, diced
* 1 1/2 cups baby peas, frozen and thawed
* 8 ounces ramen noodles
* 1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped, plus extra for garnish
* Naan (optional)

## Directions

1. In a 5-quart dutch oven, heat 6 ounces of the coconut milk over medium heat. Add the butter and curry paste and stir to combine. Cook for 2-3 minutes, then add the habanero and jalapeño. Cook until tender, approximately 4-5 minutes. Now add the sausage and a dash of salt and pepper. Toss to coat the ingredients and cook for 8-10 minutes or until the sausage is cooked through.

2. Once the sausage has cooked through, add the rest of the coconut milk and chicken broth. Bring to a boil and scrape any brown bits off the bottom of the dutch oven. Lower the heat to a simmer and add the carrots, lemongrass, fish sauce, soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, ginger, bok choy, red and orange bell peppers. Cook for 15-20 minutes then add the baby peas, ramen noodles and cilantro. Cook for 5-6 minutes or until the noodles are cooked. Season the soup again with salt and pepper to taste, and add more soy sauce if the soup seems too sweet for your liking. Remove the lemongrass stalks. Keep warm on the stove until ready to serve.

3. Garnish with cilantro and serve with Naan. Enjoy!
